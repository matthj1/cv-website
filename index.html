                        <h3>Personal</h3>
                        <p>When I’m not working I spend as much time cycling as possible. I have raced across many different disciplines including road, cyclocross and time trialling. I’m an active member of my local cycling club, sitting on a few different club committees and have helped organise several events.</p>
                        <p>I love mountains, hiking and scrambling. I try to spend as much time as I can in the Lake District, Scotland, Pyrenees and Alps. I enjoy landscape photography and find it a great motivator to get out on my feet.</p>
                        <p>I’m an avid music fan; I play guitar and bass and take a keen interest in music production. I’ve worked with several bands to produce short albums and individual tracks.</p>
